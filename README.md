## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Fylo dark theme landing page

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Tailwind + Javascript
  - Oh my god, what a challenge this was! This one was, by some margin, the hardest one I did so far. To figure out the design and the Javascript logic in it was very hard for me. I know this was is not perfect, but I had to post it in order to ask for opinions. 
  - I wanted to try using Tailwind and found a great Youtube channel that shows the resolution of this challenge with the use of this technology. I've never used Tailwind before and I opted to follow on the code from the Youtube, with slighly variations. This was a great opportunity to learn this new type of page building and I learned a lot from it.
